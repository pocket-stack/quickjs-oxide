# quickjs-oxide

An independent Rust rewrite of QuickJS, targeting semantic feature parity with
the official **QuickJS 2026-06-04** release and its ES2025 behavior.

The `unsafe`-free engine is runnable but incomplete. The current R3ac milestone
adds ordinary async object-literal methods on the existing async execution
path, including QuickJS-compatible method identity, `super`, source, and token
timing. Oxide passes the focused 76/76 variants across 42 admitted paths;
pinned QuickJS passes all 49 candidate paths. The conservative full vector is
43,659/102,037 with no previous-pass regression. Public/private async class
methods, async generators, modules, Proxy, and broad built-in coverage remain
incomplete. Pinned QuickJS is the test oracle, never a product dependency. See
the status documents below for the R3z/R3aa/R3ab history and reproducible R3ac
evidence.

## Try it

Rust 1.85 or newer is required.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pocket-stack/quickjs-oxide.git
cd quickjs-oxide
./scripts/demo-42.sh  # 42
cargo run --quiet --bin qjs -- --print-result -e \
  '(function (a) { return a + 1; })(41)'  # 42
```
