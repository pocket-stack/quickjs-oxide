# quickjs-oxide

An independent Rust rewrite of QuickJS, targeting semantic feature parity with
the official **QuickJS 2026-06-04** release and its ES2025 behavior.

The `unsafe`-free engine is runnable, but it is not at Feature Parity yet. Its
strongest implemented slices cover ArrayBuffer/DataView/TypedArray,
SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics, collections and weak references, Promise jobs,
Unicode normalization, and a growing parser/VM surface.

The latest conformance milestone globally admits the implemented
`SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics` surfaces. Its exact 886-variant gate adds 866
passes with no regression; Oxide and pinned QuickJS both pass every variant
that is not intentionally retained behind cross-realm support. The next
shared-memory frontier is the Test262 `$262.agent` host (59 paths / 118
variants). Modules, workers, broad built-ins, and the complete
embedding/tooling surface also remain unfinished. Pinned QuickJS has no
`Atomics.waitAsync`, so it is outside this rewrite's parity target.

The latest audited global vector is 66,476 passes / 66,528 runnable / 102,037
total variants. Detailed implementation and Test262 bookkeeping lives in the
status documents below, keeping this page focused on trying the engine.

**[Open the browser playground →](https://pocket-stack.github.io/quickjs-oxide/)**
— it runs this Rust engine's actual WebAssembly build, not host `eval`. The
page reports its exact build commit, QuickJS target, and non-blocking browser
host policy. Curated examples include a function returning 42 and the
`Atomics.wait` host-policy boundary. The playground is a pre-parity milestone,
not a Feature Parity claim.

## Try it

Rust 1.85 or newer is required.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pocket-stack/quickjs-oxide.git
cd quickjs-oxide
./scripts/demo-42.sh  # 42
cargo run --quiet --bin qjs -- --print-result -e \
  '(function (a) { return a + 1; })(41)'  # 42
```
